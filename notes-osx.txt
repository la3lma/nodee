To compile nodee, you need the libzookeper library.  One way of
getting that is to install it using the macports ports collection:


   tabla:~ rmz2$ sudo port install libzookeeper
   Password:
   Warning: port definitions are more than two weeks old, consider using
   selfupdate
   --->  Fetching archive for libzookeeper
   --->  Attempting to fetch libzookeeper-3.3.4_0.darwin_10.x86_64.tbz2
   from http://packages.macports.org/libzookeeper
   --->  Attempting to fetch
   libzookeeper-3.3.4_0.darwin_10.x86_64.tbz2.rmd160 from
   http://packages.macports.org/libzookeeper
   --->  Installing libzookeeper @3.3.4_0
   --->  Activating libzookeeper @3.3.4_0
   --->  Cleaning libzookeeper
   
This will drop the files in /opt/local/include/zookeeper, so  this
will have to be included in the search path(s) for the compiler.
